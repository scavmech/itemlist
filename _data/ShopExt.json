This timid nature and their comparative strength have made them attractive stock for space slavers, and so the Gerzee have just started to be introduced to modern technologies as they deal with these foreign attacks.\n\nWith their four eyes on top of their flat head, bulky bodies, and large arms, most humanoid equipment simply doesn’t fit the Gerzee physique. They’re only able to squeeze into some loose or adjustable clothing (e.g. parkas, dusters, masks, flak gear), handle some of the “larger” melee weapons (e.g. spears, horns, swords), and use ranged weapons that don’t require “normal-sized” fingers to pull the trigger (i.e. a minigun).\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAnother technology that surprisingly doesn’t work for the Gerzee is the act of cooking food. However, it’s unclear as to why cooking plants makes them inedible for the Gerzee biology, since slavers don’t mind feeding them cheap hay and glitterworlds have not been interested in researching the answer for such a primitive species.\n(Gerzee Race)",
